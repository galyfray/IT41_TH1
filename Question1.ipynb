They finally found a system which is still used nowadays for confidential communications and safe authentification online.   "

They have to cypher their messages before sending them. That's why by using RSA encryption Alice who wants to receive Bob's secret message created the required keys and shares the public keys $(n,e)$ to Bob (and indirectly Eve since she's spying) but keeps secret the private key $d$. Then, Bob encrypts his message $M$ with $n$ and $e$ : $$M^{e}\\equiv C\\mod{n}$$\n",

Computing this function for p a prime number is easely since a prime number is coprime with $\\forall a < p-1$. What makes that we have : $$\\phi(n) = \\phi(p\\times q) = (p-1)(q-1)$$\n",
