    "Let $A$ and $B$ be two $T$-matrices of size $(n+1)\\times(n+1)$, with $a_{i, j}$ and $b_{i, j}$ the factors of these matrices, $T$-matrices are defined so that $a_{i+1, j+1} = a_{i, j}$ and similarly for the matrix $B$, finally if we sum $A$ and $B$ to obtain the matrix $C$, let's define $c_{i, j}$ the factors of $C$.\n",

    "We obtain that $$c_{i, j} = a_{i, j} + b_{i, j}$$ and in particular for $i+1$ and $j+1$ we obtain $$c_{i+1, j+1} = a_{i+1, j+1} + b_{i+1, j+1}\\\\\n",
